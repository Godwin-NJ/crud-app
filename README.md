# crud-app
A simple Crud App using express JS  MongoDB and EJS

HEROKU URL TO WEBSITE = 
https://simple-crud-app-gnj.herokuapp.com/

Pls Note - my heroku url is down , i am working hard to ensure it comes up pls exercise patience . 

ROUTES
1) / => using a get response, this the landing page of the app
2) /data =>using a post request, it pushes form data to the database as an object 
3) /put => it updates the data on the browser as well as the database
Pls note : for this update request - for now we are updating only names starting with jude ( all in smaller character) 
that means if you want to test the update, input jude as name and fill the other inputs and onclicking on update it updates to a new name and details 
4) /delete => This delete all the names updated formerly having jude as name . 

Thanks for checking this up -> we are still building this app and when next you check this repository it should be having an amazing app very user friendly
